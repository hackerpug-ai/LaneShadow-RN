# Android Learnings: PLAN-S08-AND-T03 — Sketch Polyline Overlay

## Implementation Date
2026-05-14

## Overview
Implemented `MapSketchAnimationLayer` composable that renders a copper sketch-polyline with continuous 1400ms linear animation loop and a breathing head-dot at 1400ms ease-in-out reversed. Animation respects system reduced-motion preference.

## Edge Cases Discovered

### 1. Empty Path Handling
**Issue**: Need to prevent crash when path is empty
**Solution**: Early return guard at composable entry point
```kotlin
if (path.isEmpty()) {
    return
}
```
**Learning**: Both SketchPolylineCanvas and SketchHeadDot composables also guard internally

### 2. Reduced-Motion System Setting
**Issue**: How to detect system reduced-motion preference
**Solution**: Accept `reducedMotionEnabled` parameter from caller
**Note**: Caller can determine this via `Settings.Global.getFloat(contentResolver, Settings.Global.ANIMATOR_DURATION_SCALE, 1f) == 0f`
This task leaves the detection to the caller (PlanningScreen) and just respects the flag

### 3. Animation State with Dynamic Theme
**Issue**: Animation timing must not change if user switches theme mid-composition
**Solution**: Theme tokens are resolved at composition time via `LocalLaneShadowTheme.current`
If theme changes, the composable recomposes and re-reads the recipe

### 4. Path Coordinate System
**Issue**: LatLng coordinates need to be projected to screen space for Canvas drawing
**Solution**: Simple linear mapping is used in this implementation as a placeholder
Real integration would use Mapbox's projection matrix when overlaying on actual map

## API Contract Notes

### Parameters
- `path: List<LatLng>` — Route coordinates; empty list is valid (renders nothing)
- `reducedMotionEnabled: Boolean` — Caller determines system reduced-motion setting
- `onProgressUpdate`, `onHeadDotAlphaUpdate`, `onStrokeColorResolved` — Optional testing callbacks

### No Repository Subscriptions
This is a pure presentation layer. Caller (PlanningScreen) is responsible for:
- Collecting sketch route from PlanningViewModel
- Determining reduced-motion setting from system
- Passing data as parameters

### Unexpected States
- **Very short paths (1-2 points)**: Canvas still renders, head dot appears at last point
- **Null path**: Parameter is non-nullable; caller must ensure non-null List
- **Very long paths (1000+ points)**: Performance untested; may need optimization for draw calls

## UI Decisions

### 1. Animation Recipe Reuse
**Decision**: Reuse `sketchPolylineRecipe(theme)` helper from PlanningScreen.kt
**Rationale**: Single source of truth for animation timing across the codebase
**Alternative Considered**: Define new motion recipe in LSMotion.kt (rejected to avoid duplication)

### 2. Reduced-Motion Collapse Strategy
**Decision**: Static values (1.0 for both progress and alpha) when reduced-motion enabled
**Rationale**: Rider still sees the polyline and dot, just without movement
**Alternative Considered**: Completely hide layer (rejected; visibility is important)

### 3. Separate Composables for Canvas Layers
**Decision**: Split SketchPolylineCanvas and SketchHeadDot as separate private composables
**Rationale**: Cleaner composition structure, easier to test behavior independently
**Alternative Considered**: Single Canvas with both polyline and dot (less modular)

### 4. Theme Color Resolution
**Decision**: Use `isSystemInDarkTheme()` + GeneratedTokens directly (not LocalLaneShadowTheme.semantic)
**Rationale**: Consistent with LSMapTypes.kt pattern for route colors
**Note**: `semantic.route.best` resolves to the same colors as `color.Route.best/dark.best`

## Gotchas for iOS Implementer

### 1. Animation Timing Is Fixed (1400ms)
**Android**: Reads from motion token `duration["verySlow"]` which equals 1400ms
**iOS**: Must use same 1400ms linear for path-draw and 1400ms ease-in-out for breathing
**Note**: This is by design for cross-platform parity. Do NOT use configurable animations.

### 2. RepeatMode.Reverse Behavior
**Android**: `infiniteRepeatable(..., repeatMode = RepeatMode.Reverse)` means:
- Animation runs forward: 0 → 1
- Then reverses: 1 → 0
- Full cycle = 2800ms (1400ms forward + 1400ms reverse)
**iOS**: Ensure CABasicAnimation or equivalent has same `autoreverses = true` behavior

### 3. Reduced-Motion Must Be Respected
**Android**: When system animator-duration-scale is 0, the entire animation system pauses
**iOS**: Likely equivalent: `UIAccessibility.isReduceMotionEnabled`
**Critical**: Do NOT skip this guard. Accessibility is gate-blocking.

### 4. Copper Color Token
**Android**: Resolves via `GeneratedTokens.color.Route.best` (light) / `dark.best` (dark)
**iOS**: Ensure token resolution uses same copper value across themes
**Verify**: Design tokens are in sync between platforms

### 5. Path Geometry Projection
**Android**: This implementation uses simplified linear projection for Canvas rendering
**iOS**: Will likely use MapKit's projection or similar native API
**Note**: Coordinate system and rendering approach may differ; ensure visual parity through design review

## Files Created/Modified

### Created
- `android/app/src/main/java/com/laneshadow/ui/atoms/MapSketchAnimationLayer.kt` (new)
  - Main composable + private helpers (SketchPolylineCanvas, SketchHeadDot)
- `android/app/src/test/java/com/laneshadow/ui/atoms/MapSketchAnimationLayerTest.kt` (new)
  - 7 source-text verification tests

### Not Modified (Write-Prohibited)
- LSMap.kt (Sprint 06 host)
- LSMapHost.kt (Sprint 06 host)
- PlanningScreen.kt (only references recipe helper, no changes)

## Design Token Compliance

✓ No hardcoded color hex values (uses GeneratedTokens.color.Route.best/dark.best)
✓ No hardcoded duration (uses sketchRecipe.durationMillis from theme)
✓ No hardcoded easing (uses sketchRecipe.easing from theme)
✓ Token compliance check: `enforce-native-compliance.sh` passes
✓ Kotlin lint: `ktlintCheck` passes

## Test Coverage

| head_dot_breathing_cycles_at_1400ms_easeinout | Verify breathing easing | ✓ |

| uses_motion_recipe_tokens_not_hardcoded_values | Verify token purity | ✓ |

## Performance Notes

- Animation uses Compose's `infiniteRepeatable` which is efficient for infinite loops
- Canvas rendering happens at composition time (not real-time path projection)
- No LaunchedEffect for animation setup; uses Compose animation framework directly
- Early return for empty path prevents unnecessary Canvas allocations

## Integration Status

✓ Ready for integration with PlanningScreen
✓ Can accept path from PlanningUiState.sketchRoute (exposed by AND-T02)
✓ Ready for cross-platform parity verification with iOS (PLAN-S08-IOS-T03)
✓ Ready for E2E testing (PLAN-S08-T11)

## Known Limitations

1. **Canvas Coordinate Projection**: Uses simplified linear mapping, not actual Mapbox projection
   - Fine for testing; real integration would use Mapbox bounds/projection
2. **No Text/Label**: Head dot is just a circle, no label or annotation
3. **Static Head Dot Position**: Dot stays at last path point; doesn't move with path animation

## Recommendations for iOS

1. Verify animation timing with timeline or debugger: 1400ms linear for path, 1400ms ease-in-out for breathing
2. Test reduced-motion: should see static polyline + static dot (no animation)
3. Verify copper color matches Android across light/dark themes
4. Consider similar structure: separate layers for path animation + dot breathing
5. Use CABasicAnimation with `autoreverses = true` for breathing effect (or SwiftUI equivalent)
