# Ride Flow State Machine - Native Rewrite UC

**Document ID:** UC-FLOW
**Status:** Draft
**Last Updated:** 2026-04-16

## Overview

This document defines the ride flow state machine that manages the entire ride lifecycle for LaneShadow's native rewrite. The state machine handles user journeys from map discovery through route planning, preview, navigation, recording, and completion.

## State Machine Definition

### States

```
IDLE → DISCOVERING → PLANNING → PREVIEWING → NAVIGATING → RECORDING → COMPLETED
```

### State Descriptions

| State | Description | Entry Trigger | Exit Conditions |
|-------|-------------|---------------|-----------------|
| **IDLE** | Map view, no active ride, ready to discover | App launch, ride completion, session reset | User sends message, loads saved session |
| **DISCOVERING** | Browsing routes, filtering, search UI active | User activates search/browse | User sends planning message, selects route |
| **PLANNING** | AI generating routes, processing natural language | User sends planning message | Routes generated, error occurs, user cancels |
| **PREVIEWING** | Route selected, comparing options, ride preparation | User selects route from results | User starts navigation, exports to external app |
| **NAVIGATING** | Turn-by-turn navigation active, metrics displayed | User starts ride navigation | Ride ends, user aborts navigation |
| **RECORDING** | Ride recording active, waypoints tracked | Navigation ends, recording begins | Ride completed, recording stopped |
| **COMPLETED** | Ride summary, save/share options | Recording stops with valid data | User starts new ride, returns to map |

### Transitions

| From | To | Trigger | Guard |
|------|-----|---------|-------|
| IDLE | PLANNING | SEND_MESSAGE action | Message content non-empty |
| IDLE | PREVIEWING | LOAD_SESSION action | Valid session data exists |
| DISCOVERING | PLANNING | SEND_MESSAGE action | Message content non-empty |
| DISCOVERING | PREVIEWING | SELECT_ROUTE action | Route ID exists in results |
| PLANNING | PREVIEWING | PLANNING_SUCCESS action | Routes generated successfully |
| PLANNING | IDLE | PLANNING_ERROR action | No existing routes to fallback to |
| PLANNING | PREVIEWING | CANCEL_PLANNING action | Existing routes from refinement |
| PREVIEWING | PLANNING | SEND_MESSAGE action | Refinement message |
| PREVIEWING | NAVIGATING | START_NAVIGATION action | Selected route ID exists |
| PREVIEWING | IDLE | NEW_SESSION action | User confirms reset |
| NAVIGATING | RECORDING | NAVIGATION_COMPLETE event | Valid navigation session |
| NAVIGATING | PREVIEWING | ABORT_NAVIGATION action | User cancels navigation |
| RECORDING | COMPLETED | RECORDING_COMPLETE event | Valid ride data captured |
| RECORDING | PREVIEWING | DISCARD_RECORDING action | User confirms discard |
| COMPLETED | IDLE | NEW_SESSION action | User accepts or dismisses summary |

### Guards

```typescript
// Platform-agnostic guard logic
interface Guards {
  canSendMessage(content: string): boolean
  canSelectRoute(routeId: string | null): boolean
  canStartNavigation(selectedRouteId: string | null): boolean
  canCompleteRecording(waypoints: Waypoint[]): boolean
}
```

## UC-FLOW-01: State Machine Overview

### Description
The ride flow state machine provides a type-safe, predictable way to manage ride lifecycle transitions. It ensures invalid states are unreachable and all transitions are explicit and guarded.

**UI Components (from Sprint 2):**
- `BaseViewLayout` (template) — root container observing state machine output
- `MenuLayout` (template) — shell hosting map + drawer for all ride-flow states
- `ErrorBoundary` (template) — catches state machine render errors
- `ConnectionBanner` (molecule) — surfaces connectivity gating for transitions
- `Banner` (molecule) — conveys state-driven informational messaging

**New Compositions Needed:**
- `RideFlowStateProvider` (proposed template) — wraps children with StateFlow/@Observable state and dispatch context; no existing RN analog

### Preconditions
- App is initialized
- Storage layer is hydrated
- User is authenticated (if applicable)

### Main Flow
1. State machine initializes in IDLE state
2. User actions trigger state transitions via dispatch
3. Guards validate transition conditions
4. State updates atomically
5. UI reacts to state changes
6. State persists to storage on each transition

### Acceptance Criteria

#### Android (Given/When/Then)
- **Given** the app is launched
- **When** the state machine initializes
- **Then** the initial state is IDLE with no active session
- **And** the state is exposed via StateFlow<RideFlowState>
- **And** all states are represented as sealed class subclasses
- **And** transitions are validated by guards before state changes

#### iOS (Given/When/Then)
- **Given** the app is launched
- **When** the state machine initializes
- **Then** the initial state is IDLE with no active session
- **And** the state is exposed via @Published var state: RideFlowState
- **And** all states are represented as enum with associated values
- **And** transitions are validated by guards before state changes

        self.phase = phase
        self.sessionId = sessionId
        self.serializedData = serializedData
    }
